# Extendible Hashing Simulator

The main purpose of this project is to create a simulator for Extendible Hash structure. As we know this hashing falls under the category of Dynamic Hashing and it plays an important role in database indexing. So by using this simulator tool, one can easily grab the idea of how extendible hashing works. Enjoy ... ... 

## Getting Started

It's better to review the theory of Extendible hashing first before using this tool. To explore how Extendible Hashing works, just click [here](https://www.slideshare.net/imamhossain75054/dbms-10-extensible-hashing-238408080).
