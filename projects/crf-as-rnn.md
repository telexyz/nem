Conditional Random Fields is a class of discriminative models best suited to prediction tasks where __contextual information or state of the neighbors affect the current prediction__. CRFs find their applications in named entity recognition, part of speech tagging, gene prediction, noise reduction and object detection problems, to name a few.
