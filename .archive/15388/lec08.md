## Graph algorithms

Algorithms for graphs could be (in fact, is) an entire course on its own. 
We’re going to briefly highlight just three algorithms that address different problem classes in graphs
1. Finding shortest paths in a graph – Dijkstra’s algorithm
2. Finding important nodes in a graph – PageRank
3. Finding communities in a graph – Girvan-Newman
