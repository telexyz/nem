Although it's not recommended that you use the parser you construct for anything serious (many excellent Python libraries already exist for parsing XML, such as the lxml library), XML files represent a fairly complex file format, that necessitates using regular expressions and recursion (or a stack) to parse these in a reasonably efficient manner.  So while it's not likely that you will need to write you own XML parser, chances are if/when you _do_ need to write a parser for some format for which there exists no good Python library, the techniques you use here will be useful for writing this parser as well."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["XML stands for the eXtensible Markup Language.

Attributes follow a tag, and are written as a list of `attr_name=\"attribute_value\"` pairs, where we can use either double quotes or single quotes around the attribute value.
