itâ€™s not guaranteed to converge in general, but each update with a single example (or a batch) tends to approach the global minimum (the average - or expected - gradient across many examples/batches is the same as the global gradient). Since the full gradient is expensive to compute for large data, this can actually be more time-efficient than doing full steps
