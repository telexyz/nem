- Yeah, I mean I don't think I love teaching.

__I love happy humans and happy humans like when I teach.__

- I wouldn't say I hate teaching, I tolerate teaching.

- But it's not like the act of teaching that I like, it's that I have something, I'm actually okay at it.

- I'm okay at teaching and people appreciate it a lot.

- And so I'm just happy to try to be helpful and teaching itself is not like the most,
I mean it can be really annoying, frustrating.

I was working on a bunch of lectures just now. I was reminded back to my days of 231n
just how much work it is to create some of these materials and make them good.

The amount of iteration and thought and you go down blind alleys and just how much you change it.

So creating something good in terms of educational value is really hard and it's not fun.

So currently, I kind of see myself as mostly a team, human person, I love nature.

- I love harmony, I love people, I love humanity.

I love emotions of humanity and I just want to be

in this solar punk little utopia. That's my happy place.

- __My happy place is people I love, thinking about cool problems,
surrounded by a lush, beautiful dynamic nature.__

## Can you speak to why you chose to leave Tesla?

- Basically, as I described, I think over time during those five years I've kind of gotten myself
into a little bit of a managerial position.

Most of my days were meetings, and growing the organization, and making decisions about, high-level strategic
decisions about the team and what it should be working on, and so on.

And it's kind of like a corporate executive role. And I can do it.

I think I'm okay at it. But it's not like fundamentally what I enjoy.

And so I think when I joined, there was no computer vision team because Tesla was just
going from the transition of using MobilEye, a third-party vendor, for all of its computer vision
to having to build its computer vision system.

So when I showed up, _there were two people_ training deep neural networks.
And they were training them at a computer at their legs, like down, there was a work.

And so I like grew that into what I think is a fairly respectable deep learning team,
a massive computer cluster, a very good data annotation organization.

And I was __very happy with where that was. It became quite autonomous__
and so I stepped away and I'm very excited to do much more technical things again.
