An adaptive algorithm is an algorithm that changes its behavior at the time it is run,[1] based on information available and on a priori defined reward mechanism (or criterion). Such information could be the story of recently received data, information on the available computational resources, or other run-time acquired (or a priori known) information related to the environment in which it operates.

As opposed to batch learning, adaptive learning collects and analyzes data in sequential order, not all at once. This enables adaptive ML models to monitor and learn from the changes in both input and output values; it allows the model to adapt its data collection, grouping, and analysis methods based on new information.
